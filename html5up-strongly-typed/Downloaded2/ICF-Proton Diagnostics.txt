Sending a beam of energetic protons through a plasma leaves an imprint of electromagnetic fields in the plasma on the protons' velocities, in the form of deviations from their initial straight-line trajectories. When the protons are caught on a detector their intensity distribution can be compared to the distribution we would expect if they were undeviated to deduce information about the path-integrated deflections, and therefore fields, experienced by the protons. Proton radiography (also known as proton imaging or deflectrometry in some configurations) is a powerful diagnostic, but presents many subtleties which must be accounted for in modelling and analysis to be useful in experiments.
