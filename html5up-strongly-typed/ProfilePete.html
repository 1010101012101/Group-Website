									<h3>Prof. Peter Norreys, Professor of Inertial Fusion Science - Oxford, Individual Merit Fellow - STFC, William Penney Fellow - AWE</h3>
									<p>Peter Norreys is Professor of Inertial Fusion Science at the University of Oxford and is an Individual Merit Fellow of the Science and Technology Facilities Council. He completed his second term as Divisional Associate Editor of Physical Review Letters in January 2017.
									<br/><br/>
									He graduated from Royal Holloway College, University of London, in 1989 and spent one year as a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Post-Doctoral Fellow at Osaka University Japan. He joined the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in 1990 on his return to the United Kingdom and has been involved in the study of relativistically intense laser-plasma interactions since then.
									<br/><br/>
									He was awarded the 2013 Institute of Physics' Payne-Gaposchkin Medal and Prize for his original contributions to relativistic laser-plasma interaction physics. He has also received the 2006 American Physical Societyâ€™s Award for Excellence in Plasma Physics Research for his contributions to inertial fusion science and, as UK team leader, the 2007 Daiwa Adrian Prize for UK-Japan collaborative investigations into new areas of high energy density science. He is currently William Penney Fellow of AWE, a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and of the American Physical Society and is a visiting Professor to Imperial College London.
									<br /><br />
									I work on particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to both compare theoretical calculations and experimental data to computational results but also to define parameter spaces in which experiments could be realised. In order to run these massively parallel PIC codes, I have access to the SCARF (STFC) and ARCHER (Edinburgh) supercomputers. I am also planning on conducting experiments at the world's leading laser facilities on the propagation of light in cluster plasmas, the behaviour of electron waves in cluster plasmas and the amplification of laser pulses using the Raman backscatter instability.
